This project focuses on building a machine learning-based clinical stroke prediction system using patient health data. The system aims to assist in early diagnosis and preventive care by accurately identifying individuals at risk of stroke.


## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 🏥 Developed a stroke prediction model achieving **89% accuracy** using real-world healthcare data.
- ⚙️ Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms:  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**  
  - **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
- 🧹 Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and addressing class imbalance.
- 📊 Conducted detailed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and statistical analysis for insightful feature engineering.
- 📈 Evaluated models using:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
  - **ROC-AUC Curve**
